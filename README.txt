The code section is in the Part 2.ipynb file and the dataset used is in the data_set folder.
Jupyter notebooks were used for this machine learning, producing .ipynb files.
The python version used is 3.9.
Four of these external libraries need to be downloaded and installed. They are pandas, nltk, scikit-learn and scipy.
There are also three libraries that come with python that need to be used, and they are glob, re, and time.
Among other things, the nltk library requires three more models to be downloaded for text cleaning. They are wordnet, punkt and stopwords.
There are four external library downloads and installations and three model download commands built into the file, but it's not clear if they can be run directly in linux. 
However, it has been confirmed to work on the Jupyter notebook web page.
The instruction boxes within the file run in a logical order from top to bottom.
The role of each part of the code is commented in detail in the code file.
